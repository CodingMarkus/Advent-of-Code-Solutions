# Advent of Code - Solutions

See [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for details.

This is a collection of puzzle solutions entirely implemeted as [POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/) conform shell scripts.


Q. Why shell scripts? Wouldn't it be much easier to solve the puzzles in \<*... insert common programming language here ...*\>? \
A. Of course it would be easier, but where would the fun be if it wasn't challenging? Already using `bash` scripting would make it a lot easier but I just want to show how powerful plain POSIX scripting in fact is.
